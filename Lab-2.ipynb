    "- Nobody shakes hands with their own spouse.\n",
    "- Nobody shakes hands with the same person twice.\n",
    "- Each of the 9 people (excluding Mr. Smith) gave a **different** answer for how many handshakes they made.\n",

    "# Reasoning:\n",
    "- Possible handshake counts range from **0 to 8** (since each person can shake hands with at most 8 others — everyone except themselves and their spouse).\n",
    "- With 9 distinct answers given, they must be exactly 0, 1, 2, …, 8.\n",
    "- Handshake counts come in **spouse pairs** that add to 8 (because if one person shakes `k` hands, their spouse shakes `8 - k` hands).\n",
